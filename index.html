                <h3><strong>Improving</strong> the performance of high-tech hardware startups</h3>
                <p>
                    Tec-Start is a consulting practice primarily targeted at improving the overall execution performance of high-tech hardware startups that require close coordination of multi-disciplinary teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This includes everything from critiquing the development plan and assessing the engineering team, to acting as temporary CTO or CEO.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Product Development Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    Product development can easily get off schedule and waste time and money. This is much more likely if there are multiple engineering projects that must be finished at particular times in order for the entire program to proceed. Because start-ups have limited resources and critical market timing requirement, these delays can be fatal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Established companies can also suffer from similar problems. While project delays are not fatal, they can lead to serious losses or missed opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While every development program is different, there are standard proven techniques that minimize schedule risk, preserve cash, and maximize the chances of a successful product launch. Since these are most effective if put in place early, it is wise to seek professional assistance before reaching a crisis stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A product development assessment can be done at any time. These are inexpensive, cost-effective insurance, and highly recommended.
